# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Nabiru**, a student currently doing an internship as a Frontend Developer.  
Even though I'm part of the FE team, I actually have a stronger interest in **Backend Development**, especially using **Golang**.

I enjoy learning how systems work behind the scenes, building clean APIs, and exploring how logic connects everything together.  
I also use **React** for frontend stuff, but my real curiosity stays on how data flows in the background.

### 🌱 About me
- 🔭 Currently an intern (PKL) and learning how real-world projects work.  
- ⚙️ Using **React** for frontend, **Golang** for backend.  
- ☕ I love **coffee**, **photography**, and a bit of **design**, even though I don’t plan to be a designer.  
- 🧩 My goal? Still figuring it out — as long as it’s in IT and pays well, I’m happy. 😄
