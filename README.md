# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Nabiru**, a student currently doing an internship as a Frontend Developer.  
Even though I'm part of the FE team, I actually have a stronger interest in **Backend Development**, especially using **Golang**.

I enjoy learning how systems work behind the scenes, building clean APIs, and exploring how logic connects everything together.  
I also use **React** for frontend stuff, but my real curiosity stays on how data flows in the background.
